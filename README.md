# Study Time Stats
Adds total and ranged study time stats to Anki's main window.  

<!-- [img] -->

## Macros
Can be used in text inputs to show different variables given by the addon.  
(e.g. "Past %range" -> "Past Week")
+ **%range** - the currently selected range format (Week, 2 Weeks, Month, Year)
+ **%from_date** - range filter's start date using the system's locale (2022-06-30)
+ **%from_weekday** - range filter's starting day using a compact format (Sun)
+ **%from_full_weekday** - range filter's full start day (Sunday)
+ **%days** - total days the range filter checks against (17)
+ **%%** - returns a single % symbol and doesn't apply the text macro (%, %range, etc)
